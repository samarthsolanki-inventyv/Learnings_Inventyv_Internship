### 06_Rust_Tasks

This folder contains Rust programs covering fundamental Rust concepts including loops, structs, serialization, concurrency, and module systems.

## 📚 Contents

### 1. **_1_Loops_Task**
Demonstrates different looping constructs in Rust:
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `loop` (infinite loops)
- Labeled loops
- Loop control with `break` and `continue`

### 2. **_2_Struct_Task**
Covers structs and their implementations:
- Defining structs
- Nested structs
- Getters and setters
- Associated methods
- Method implementations

### 3. **_3_serde_json**
Demonstrates serialization and deserialization using Serde:

#### _3_1_serialize_json
- Converting Rust data structures to JSON
- Using `serde` and `serde_json` crates
- Serialization with `#[derive(Serialize)]`

#### _3_2_deserialize_json
- Converting JSON to Rust data structures
- Deserialization with `#[derive(Deserialize)]`
- Error handling during deserialization

### 4. **_4_ownership**
Explores Rust's ownership system:
- Ownership rules
- Borrowing and references
- Mutable and immutable references
- The borrow checker

### 5. **_5_Server_Request_Tracker**
Covers concurrent programming with shared state management:

#### _5_1_Using_Mutex
- Using `Mutex<T>` for mutual exclusion
- Thread-safe shared state
- Lock acquisition and release

#### _5_2_Using_Rwlock
- Using `RwLock<T>` for read-write locks
- Multiple readers, single writer pattern
- Performance optimization for read-heavy workloads

### 6. **_6_module_system**
Demonstrates Rust's module organization:
- Using `mod` keyword to declare modules
- Using `use` keyword to import items
- Module visibility with `pub`
- Code organization and namespacing

### 7. **_7_HashMap_Task**
Explores Rust's hash-based collections:

#### _7_1_HashMap
- Creating and using `HashMap<K, V>`
- Inserting, updating, and retrieving values

#### _7_2_HashSet
- Creating and using `HashSet<T>`
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Checking membership
- Removing duplicates

### 8. _8_Inventory_Task
A comprehensive project integrating multiple Rust concepts:
- Practical application of structs, methods,traits and collections
- Inventory management system implementation
- Error handling and input validation

### 9. _9_Inventory_with_Lifetime_Closure
- Lifetime was added in generics implementation and also Closure is used instead of normal function in Display_All function

### 10. _10_Multithreaded_Application
- This application demonstrates safe, concurrent state management using Arc and Mutex in Rust.
- Concurrent Record Creation: A background thread generates unique data records every 10 seconds, utilizing an atomic counter for thread-safe ID generation.
- Real-Time State Monitoring: A dedicated printer thread snapshots the shared memory every 5 seconds, displaying records with human-readable timestamps (HH:MM:SS am/pm).
- Automated Memory Cleanup: Two independent janitor threads monitor the collection every second, removing records based on ID parity (Even/Odd) once they exceed a 20-second lifespan.
- Live Data Auditing: Separate counter threads continuously calculate and report the total number of even and odd records currently stored in the shared vector.

### 11. _11_Web_Server
- A simple HTTP server built using **Axum** and **Tokio** that manages F1 drivers.
- It demostrates
- Async Rust
- Multi-thread Tokio runtime
- Shared state using `Arc<RwLock<T>>`
- CRUD APIs
